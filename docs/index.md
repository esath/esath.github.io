## Automate Cisco ACI tasks with ServiceNow, Jenkins and Ansible


#### In this project we build ServiceNow catalog to make configuration-requests to Cisco APICs

> [ServiceNow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ServiceNow) is popular commercial software for management of "incident, problem, and change" IT operational events 
>  
> [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is open source automation server and here we use it to orchestrate Ansible-playbooks
> 
> [Cisco ACI](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/what-is-cisco-aci-x) is SDN network for datacenters


### Jenkins
>
>Jenkins installation is needed to run Ansible playbooks.
>Server with access from Internet is needed for this.

### ServiceNow Developer
>
>You can register <a href= "https://developer.servicenow.com/">free Developer instance</a> to get started with ServiceNow (Snow).
>Basic understanding of Snow is needed and if you start from scratch, you should take some of excellent lessons from Snow-portal.
>
>I will build all examples with Studio.

### Cisco ACI LAB
>
>Cisco provides <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox"> lab-environment</a> for testing and training.
>All created configuration is removed daily, but it's nice place to test your code.
